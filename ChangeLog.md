# ChangeLog for meta-sancloud

## dunfell-r4

This is a maintenance release for the Yocto Project 3.1 "dunfell" release
series.

Changes from dunfell-r3:

* Poky 3.1.10 and updates to meta-openembedded & meta-rtlwifi layers.

* Update linux-bbe to v5.4.106-sc3 and update linux-bb-rt to v5.4.106-rt54-sc3.

  * Improve support for BBE Extended WiFi variant and rename the device tree to
    `am335x-sancloud-bbe-extended-wifi.dts`.

  * Backport DTB improvements submitted upstream.

* Update u-boot-bbe to v2021.07-sc1.

  * Select appropriate device tree for the current board (BBE, BBE Lite or BBE
    Extended Wifi) at boot time.

  * Replace custom boot script with an `extlinux.conf` file generated by Yocto.

  * Drop u-boot files from boot partition as they're not needed.

* Add recipes for the qcacld driver and firmware required by the BBE Extended
  WiFi variant.

* Add sancloud-ramdisk-image recipe to provide a very lightweight image
  suitable for TFTP boot.

* Build compressed ext4 images to simplify on-device rootfs updates.

* Switch to master branch of meta-linux-mainline to provide updated mainline
  kernel support. Also dropped patches against linux-stable, mainline/stable
  kernels are now used unmodified if enabled.

* Add new kas inc files which can be used to easily add debug tools, systemd and
  connman to images.

* Improve bluetooth support by setting `MACHINE_FEATURES` appropriately.

* Small dependency tidy up to remove duplication.
